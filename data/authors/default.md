## Hello guys üëãüèª

<p>
  I&apos;m Halip and I&apos;m a frontend developer,
  designer and teacher from Makassar, Indonesia.
</p>
<p>
  After building my first website aged 23, I knew I
  wanted to work with computers and technology, and I&apos;ve
  never looked back.
</p>
<p>
  After graduating University with a Education degree, I began
  freelancing as a designer, creating graphics, video content
  and websites for small businesses, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
</p>
<p>
  In recent years, I&apos;ve been focused on programming,
  building a solid frontend stack and creating exciting
  projects that solve real-world problems.
</p> 
<p>
  People think you need degrees to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù as a designer or developer. 
  You don‚Äôt! I started with nothing. No computer science degree, No design degree. 
  I came from a Deficiency background. I was afraid to code. 
  I thought coding was something I would never be good at (even if I died trying).
</p>
