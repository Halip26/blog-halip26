## Hello guys üëãüèª

<p>
  I&apos;m Halipuddin, a Frontend Web Developer, Data Engineer, and Coding Teacher in Makassar, Indonesia. At 23, I built my first website, sparking my passion for tech. With an Education degree, I freelanced as a designer, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for graphics, video, and websites.
</p>
<p>
  Shifting to programming, I&apos;ve developed a robust frontend stack, creating projects addressing real-world issues. Simultaneously, I teach domestic and international students aged 5-16 various programming languages, fostering creativity in project-based learning. I guide students in Roblox Studio for game development.
</p>
<p>
  Actively participating in programming and design training, I stay updated with industry trends. My journey proves that formal degrees aren&apos;t essential; starting without a tech background, I overcame my coding fear, emphasizing dedication&apos;s role in success.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to technical pursuits, I excel in communicating students' progress to parents, creating a collaborative learning environment.
