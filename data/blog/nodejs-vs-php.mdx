## Overview: Node.js vs PHP
- PHP has become one of the most reliable server-side scripting languages in the developing world. It got this fame under the name of biggies like Facebook and Tumblr. 
- PHP has existed since 1995, while Node came in 2009.
- Even though Node was released late, it established itself quite quickly.
- Biggies like Netflix and LinkedIn are now using Node.js.
- PHP is synchronous and works well with any centralized server.
- While PHP is a scripting language and Node.js is a runtime environment, both are the heartbeat of backend development.

## Mixing Code With Content: Winner PHP

Do you wish to pour your thoughts into text for your website? Do you also want to add a branch to the process? Or do you wish to mix in data from the database with text?

Are you wondering how it is possible?

With PHP, you can **open up magic PHP tags and start writing code within seconds**. Regarding PHP development, you don’t need extra effort for templates. Everything is a template!


## Application Speed: Winner Node.js

In the digital world, who isn’t crazy about speed? We have so little time to wait for an application to load fully for more than 3 seconds.

According to a development stat, a website loses 27% of its customers if its page load speed exceeds 3 seconds!

No wonder writing JavaScript codes is a bit complicated due to infinite parentheses, but trust me, your Node.js application can fly once done.

The **call back mechanism** in Node.js applications is terrific. It saves you from the complications of the thread.

## Simplicity: Winner PHP

There are not many complications when it comes to code in PHP. Only a few variables and essential functions for strings and numbers.

If we dive into technicality, a thin layer does not do much except moving a few data from port 80 to the database and vice versa.

Developers say that modern databases are like a magic tool. PHP offers the appropriate amount of complexity for a job that does not need to be complicated.

## Separating Concerns: Winner Node.js

Mixing code with text isn’t as fun as it sounds. No doubt it looks all cool initially, but in no time, your codebase becomes a tangled mess of logic.

Any good programmer will work on separating the code’s cosmetic layer from the code’s logical layer.

This way, the code becomes cleaner for new programmers to understand and maintain later. The Node, js developers know life is better when you ***implement model, view, and controller concept***.

## SQL: Winner PHP

PHP was built keeping in mind a language that will coexist with MySQL and its variants. If you or the [PHP web development company](https://www.pixelcrayons.com/web-development/php-web-development?utm_source=PCBLOG-node-php&utm_medium=php-web-development&utm_campaign=DC-AR) you are working with is not comfortable with MySQL, then there are other great SQL databases from Oracle and Microsoft.

Developers can easily integrate all the power of SQL into a PHP project.

## Solidarity: Winner Node.js

Are you willing to invest in two different code bases for one application? But what will happen when your code runs on only one of the two codebases?

Competition is useless if you have to spend weeks or months rewriting your code.

While Node.js experienced its fragmentation a few years ago, with the release of io.js, the Node.js universe has since come together, giving it the kind of language solidarity that PHP developers may soon want.

## Ultimate Winner of Node.js vs. PHP

Though PHP is lightweight and easy to code for enterprise-level applications, my choice and suggestion out of Node.js vs. PHP would be Node.js. The two reasons are security and application speed.

Node.js Wins!

## Pros of Using Node.js In An Application

### 1. Non-Blocking Code: 
Node.js is an event-driven language, and most of its code runs based on callbacks. You must be wondering how this approach does any good. With this approach, the application does not sleep or pause. Instead, it becomes available for other requests. So Node.js is a clear winner when it comes to analyzing Node.js vs. PHP popularity for fast-performing applications.

### 2. Faster Performance of the Web Application:
As discussed above, Node has a zero-blocking, I/O driven model, making the request processing part very fast.

### 3. Microservices Architecture & Its Scalability Benefits:
Since it is a lightweight scripting tool, it is highly recommended for microservices architecture.

Since it is a lightweight scripting tool, it is highly recommended for [microservices architecture.](https://www.pixelcrayons.com/blog/benefits-of-microservices-architecture/)

## The Question that May Arise Here is What Microservice Architecture Is?

Well, microservices architecture is an approach to developing single applications. These applications run their process while communicating using a lightweight mechanism, often an HTTP resource API.

Adding microservices is much easier than the existing ones to integrate additional functions with the application’s basic functionality.

Additionally, each microservice communicates with the database directly through flows. This architecture allows better performance and application speed.

A match made in heaven supports two widely used frameworks for microservices architecture: Express and Restify.

## Pros Of Using PHP In An Application

### 1. Higher Page Load Speed: 

The use of PHP has made website pages load faster in comparison to any other server-side technology.

***Did you know? PHP is currently three times faster than Python for many use case scenarios.***

Lesser loading time is also one of the best SEO practices. It helps a website rank better and promotes a website by bringing competitive advantages.

High page speed is critical in keeping customers satisfied and building and retaining a client base.

### 2. Allows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Usage:

PHP allows PHP developers to manage the spaghetti code quickly based on the four divine principles, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

- **Encapsulation** is a process of grouping variables and similar functions into a single unit called an object;
- **Abstraction** is when you hide some parts of the object to facilitate its perception. In addition, it allows to reduce the influence of changes;
- **The inheritance** includes reducing redundant code. Instead of redefining all the methods and properties from start to finish, you can define them once in the generic object and have other things adopt them.
- **Polymorphism** is a process to reduce the occurrence of change and case statements.

Working with OOP helps you in keeping your code neat and clean. You can always **hire PHP developers** for better use of the concept. 

## Limitations of Node.js As A Server-Side Language:

### 1. Risk of Callback Hell:
Since Node.js has an asynchronous nature, it relies heavily on callbacks.

Callbacks are functions that run after each task in the queue is finished to inform the system about the action’s response.

Callback hell is a phenomenon that occurs when there are too many tasks queued up in the background.

In simple terms, it is a situation where callbacks are nested amongst themselves, making it difficult to understand and work on the code.

### 2. Can Be Quite Heavy:
A non-blocking I/O model means you answer the customer’s call to initiate a request. It then processes the task for as long as the callback fires when the job is ready. While processing tasks asynchronously, Node executes the JS code in its only thread per event. It is called an event loop.

When you receive a CPU-bound task, the problem occurs: every time a heavy request hits the event loop, all available CPUs are configured to process it first. Then it responds to other queued requests, one by one.

This results in slow processing and an overall delay in the event loop. Therefore, it is not recommended for heavy calculations.

## Limitations of Using PHP As A Server-Side Technology

### 1. Flexibility But at the Cost of Consistency:
The other side of PHP’s flexibility is its inconsistency. The lack of strict architecture and structure allows developers to choose the form of encoding that is most convenient for them. It means that the codes of different PHP developers may look different.

Also, one of the code structure problems is what the IT community likes to call Spaghetti code, which is a poorly structured application with code that is difficult to understand and maintain.

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities:
PHP gets a bad rap for security because of the low barrier to entry for novice programmers. As a result, several websites and applications are developed by inexperienced programmers, trainees, or even amateurs.

The poor results of your work contribute to rumours and facts regarding poor security and the overall performance of PHP. 

## Final Words
The right way of choosing any language for your project would be to first come up with your project’s requirements and then find out which language is helping you the most in fulfilling those requirements.

Say if you are a young startup with a tight budget and lesser traffic, you can give PHP a try, and later when your business flourish, you can migrate to Node.js.

If you are still confused about Node.js vs PHP, you can seek a consultation or professional help and quickly get in touch with India’s top software consulting company and get your job done.
