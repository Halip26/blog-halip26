## Boost programmer productivity with these 10 VS Code extensions for Web Development

Are you looking for some great Visual Studio Code extensions to help with your web development? Look no further! In this post, I’ll share the top 10 extensions for Visual Studio Code.

These extensions can make your development process easier and more efficient.

To install these extensions click on the extension icon of VS Code. Search for the extension and press ‘install’.

So, without further ado, let’s get started!


1. [CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)

    This directly peeks CSS ID and class from HTML files and goes to the respective CSS definition.

2. [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)

    After opening a tag in HTML and XML it’s a hectic job to close it. So here is the best solution for you, closing the HTML and XML tag automatically.

3. [JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets) 

    This is a great time-saver for any JavaScript developer. You can get all of the code you need in one place, without having to type it out again and again!
This also includes TypeScript/TSLint checked codes as well so your projects stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

4. [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    
    This extension will help you to format the JavaScript, HTML, CSS code. You can configure it as you need.

5. [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

    This renames tags automatically so that your code remains consistent and easy to maintain, even when working on bigger projects with lots of elements deep in the HTML structure.

    It works seamlessly without any need for manual updating or anything like that.

6. [Path intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
    
    Path intellisense is a great tool that makes it easier for files Path.

    With autocomplete, you won’t have to type out all of your filenames or search through folders looking at which ones are named correctly! It automatically adds file names.

7. [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

    Commenting is a big part of programming, and without it, you’ll never be able to understand your own or others’ code.

    This extension lets you organize comments by categorizing them into highlighting text, questions, todo, errors/ warnings & strikethroughs so that they’re easy for reading when looking through the project later on!

8. [MarkDown all in one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

    Developers, whether you like it or not. Writing documentation is part of the job- one that many people find themselves doing often but don’t necessarily enjoy as much because there are so many other aspects involved in developing software such as coding, testing, etc.

    The most commonly used markup for documents nowadays seems to be markdown which provides useful shortcuts when writing down content especially since live preview features can help save time by checking how your post will look before publishing! It really speeds up documents.

9. [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

    With the GitLens extension, you can see who changed what line of code in your web app. With a single click! This is one way that it makes browsing through history easy because now there’s no need to go back and forth between pages or screens when looking for certain changes - just view them all at once with this amazing tool.

10. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

     I always wanted to have this extension when I started learning web development. It spins up a light Node.js server and serves your HTML file with all assets from the given directory, on top of that any saved changes you make will also be reflected immediately in a browser which gives a really fast experience as if it is redevelopment mode!

    You can find these tools under the “Modern” category.

    So launch a local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages.
